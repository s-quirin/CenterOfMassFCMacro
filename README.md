# CenterOfMass
## A Macro for FreeCAD
Compute and show the center of mass for multiple solids

[Follow the discussion](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=31883)  
[Go to official repository](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-macros)

## Usage:
1. Select one or multiple solids.
2. Launch the macro.
3. You'll have a window listing the solids. You can put the density of your
   material in different unit systems or choose from predefined materials.

## Options:
* Color the solids according to density.
* Display where is the center of mass.
* Import densities (even if it's not a .csv file from the macro, as soon as
  there is a column named "Density").
* Save densities in the document or export to a csv-file
